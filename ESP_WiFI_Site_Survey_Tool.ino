/*
   An ESP8266 or ESP32 1.3" OLED WiFi Signal Strength Site Survey Tool/Utility.
   As you move around you can determine signal strength of a WiFi Router or Extender, which is useful
   for determining where poor Wi-Fi reception is going to be or is being encountered.
   The networks are displayed in signal strength order from highest to lowest.
